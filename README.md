# ObjectBox_VectorDB

## Here, I used Objectbox VectorDB, a new and efficient way of vector embeddings, with OpenAI's newly launched GPT-4o(omni) model.

### 1. Used GPT-4o(omni) model from OpenAI.
### 2. Took US_cencus PDFs for querying.
### 3. For word embeddings, used OpenAIEmbeddings.
### 4. Used **ObjectBox VectorDB** stores for storing vectors.
### 5. Finally, created retrieval chain and invoked it for answering the query.

## The final experience is really fabulous.
